# Random code

This is basically some random code I had laying around and wanted to backup. You can copy it freely if you find it useful in some way. It's mainly in English although my mother tongue is Spanish, but I learned how to code in English.

Most of the stuff is about GNU/Linux :penguin:

See you around!
